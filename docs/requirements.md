## User Stories

**US-01 – Publishing a product listing** (FR-01, FR-02)
As a farmer, I want to publish a listing for my product with its price and available quantity, so that consumers can find and buy it without an intermediary.
1. Given a logged-in farmer, when they submit the listing form with a name, category, price, quantity and location, the new listing appears in the list of active listings.
2. Given a logged-in farmer, when they submit the form with an empty name or a price of zero or less, the listing is not saved and an error message explains which field is wrong.

**US-02 – Ordering a product directly** (FR-03, FR-04, FR-05)
As a consumer, I want to search for a product and order the amount I need from a farmer, so that I can buy fresh products directly from the producer.
1. Given listings for several products, when the consumer searches for "tomato", only listings whose name contains "tomato" are shown.
2. Given a listing with 50 kg available, when the consumer orders 10 kg, the order is saved with cash on delivery as the payment method and the available quantity becomes 40 kg.

**US-03 – Updating the status of an order** (FR-06)
As a farmer, I want to see the orders placed on my listings and update their status, so that the consumer knows when the order is being prepared and delivered.
1. Given a new order on the farmer's listing, when the farmer opens the orders page, the order is shown with the status Pending.
2. Given a Pending order, when the farmer changes its status to Preparing, the new status is saved and is still shown as Preparing after the page is refreshed.
